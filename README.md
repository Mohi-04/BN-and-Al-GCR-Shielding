# BN-and-Al-GCR-Shielding
This project compares how effectively Boron Nitride and Aluminium can shield against space radaitons, specially Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCR).
The metrics analyzed were viz. Dose Equivalent against Areal Density and Flux of different kinds of particles against Kinetic Energy.
